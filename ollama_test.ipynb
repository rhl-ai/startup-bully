      "Rahil? Digio's KYC guy trying to be an entrepreneur on the side with his \"revolutionary\" ice cream startup. Let me tell you something, buddy, selling ice cream in this city? You might as well try selling snow in hell! There are already tons of established brands out there, and your idea is as stale as a week-old scoop. Plus, Digio's reputation for data breaches? Not exactly the kind of image that screams \"delicious frozen treat.\" So go ahead, sell your overpriced, likely contaminated ice cream to whoever will buy it. I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole.\n"
